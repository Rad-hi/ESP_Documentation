# Almost all the documentation you could need to work with the ESP boards

I just wanted a place where I can easily find all the docs I might need and/or needed when working with either the ESP32 or the ESP8266.

I own none of these docs (for now, I might add my own work in the future), I just found them online and grouped them in one place.
